Welcome to the Streamlit Fruit Menu Application repository! This project was created as part of my Snowflake DBAW Hands On Essentials to demonstrate the power of Streamlit for creating interactive applications that integrate with external APIs and databases.

## Overview
This Streamlit application combines the goodness of healthy fruit options with data integration capabilities. Here's what you can find in this repository:
- **Breakfast Menu:** Start your day right with our selection of healthy breakfast options. Whether you're a fan of Omega 3 & Blueberry Oatmeal, Kale, Spinach & Rocket Smoothie, or a simple Hard-Boiled Free-Range Egg, we've got you covered.
- **Build Your Own Fruit Smoothie:** Unleash your creativity! Create your own customized fruit smoothie by picking from a curated list of fruits. The nutritional information for your chosen fruits is displayed in a clear table format.
- **Fruityvice Fruit Advice:** Wondering about the nutritional content of a specific fruit? Just input the fruit's name, and we'll fetch the relevant information for you from the Fruityvice API. No more guesswork, just accurate data.
- **View Fruit List:** Explore our comprehensive list of fruits that are stored in our Snowflake database. Get a glimpse of the variety we offer and maybe discover some new favorites.
- **Add Fruit to the List:** Help us expand our fruit list! Add a new fruit to our Snowflake database directly from the application. Just enter the fruit's name, click a button, and it's instantly added.
